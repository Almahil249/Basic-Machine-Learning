Assignment-1: Bayesian lab
Using: GaussianNB classifire
• Implement from scratch function: train_test_split (data, labels, testRatio =0.3)
• Draw decision boundaries
• Implement from scratch function: calculate_accuracy(predicted_y , y)

Assignment-2: Linear Models lab
Generate 1000 linear samples that follow the following equation:
• Y = 5X1 + 3X2 + 1.5X3 + 6
• Implement Loss & gradientDescent functions
• Print the final weights & Accuracy
